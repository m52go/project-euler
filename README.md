<h1>Project Euler</h1>
<p>Problems are located at <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>.</p>
<p>My goal here is to learn efficient coding...cool algorithms, etc.</p>
<p>First problem was done in Python, because I was exploring Django at the time. I've since switched to Ruby and Rails, so I'll probably use Ruby going forward.</p>
<p>For the sake of thoroughness, 1.py was written on September 24, 2012. Going forward, code will be pushed as it is written.</p>
