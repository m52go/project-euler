<h1>Project Euler</h1>
<p>Problems are located at <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>.</p>
<p>My goal here is to learn efficient coding...cool algorithms, etc.</p>
<p>For the sake of thoroughness, 1.py was written on September 24, 2012. Going forward, code will be pushed as it is written.</p>

<p>Please excuse the break in updates. As a student at the Boston Startup School, I've been inundated with events, classes, and people, and this had to take a back seat. More soon! (12-15-2012)</p>
