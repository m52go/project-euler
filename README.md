<h1>Project Euler</h1>
<p>Problems are located at <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>.</p>
<p>My goal here is to learn efficient coding...cool algorithms, etc.</p>
<p>For the sake of thoroughness, pe1.py was written on September 24, 2012. Going forward, code will be pushed as it is written.</p>

<p>I have started using IPython to run and test my scripts, and it's tricky to
import code in filenames that start with numbers. To accommodate this, all
filenames will now be in the form "pe[number]". Improved algorithms will be in
the form "pe[number]e". (02-05-2013)</p>
